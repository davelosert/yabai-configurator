# Yabai Configurator

**This is a heavy work in progress repository.**

## Idea

With this repository, I want to make working with yabai, skhd and ubersicht easier by providing a single configuration file in combination with powerful CLI Commands that add some logic on top of yabai - for example predefined window-layouts that can be activated by a single hotkey.

### Planned Features

- [ ] Configure & Switch to preconfigured window layouts (see configuration example below)
  - [ ] Write a script comparing the current with the desired layout and generate `yabai` commands accordingly
- [ ] Implement a holistic CLI Interface to execute all features
- [ ] I3wm-Like focussing of spaces and/or windows for a shortcut, (e.g. `CMD + 1` for VSCode, `CMD + 2` for Firefoxâ€¦)
  - [ ] Implement a generator to inject a custom, generated config into the SKHD-Config
- [ ] Toggle through windows of a certain kind (e.g. all opened Firefox Windows)
- [ ] I3wm-Like modes for SKHD in combination with a Ubersicht-Visualization

### Configuration
